# Additional Notes

Due to the way that Cameron Snoap and Kyle Taylor worked on this assignment, it may look as though their is more commit history on one end than there is on another. This is due to multiple reasons:
   1. As we developed our web application, we utilized the Live-share tool to work in the same environment at the same time.
   2. During our development time, at one point one of us pushed a commit labeled 'Text boxes' that caused '760 changed files with 1,587,832 additions and 12 deletions.'  Due to the sheer massive amount of changes that occurred, we worried it would mess up the other person's coding environment (as it initially did to Cameron. It took him a bit of time to get things working once again and we figured it would be safer to continue to push from Kyle's development enviroment). For this reason, most pushes appear to have came from Kyle, when in reality, our commit history was very well balanced.
   3. In the name of some commits, the person who contributed is listed in the commit (Not every one of them, but some of more important logical implementations).
